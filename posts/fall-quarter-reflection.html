        <p><em>This quarter was busy — but the kind of busy that teaches you things.</em></p>

        <p>
          Going into fall quarter, I expected intensity. Seven classes, leadership roles across multiple student
          organizations, and uncertainty around my professional path meant I knew I would be stretched.
          What I didn’t expect was how much I would grow to enjoy that pace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Somewhere between deadlines, late nights, and new conversations, the chaos started to feel grounding.
          Submitting the bulk of my transfer applications lifted a weight I had been carrying quietly for months.
          For the first time in a while, I could focus less on what was looming ahead and more on what was directly in front of me.
        </p>

        <h2>Expectations vs. reality</h2>

        <p>
          At the start of the quarter, I wasn’t sure what my professional situation would look like.
          Academically, I expected to be overloaded. Personally, I was excited to reconnect with friends
          and meet new people through clubs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reality exceeded those expectations. I joined KCC Capital Partners as a Pharma/Biotech Investment Banking Analyst,
          managed my coursework more effectively than I anticipated, and met a lot of new people who quickly became friends.
          The busyness didn’t feel draining — it felt purposeful.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning how I think</h2>

        <p>
          Chemistry was the hardest class for me. I’ve never been good at it, and that didn’t change.
          But other classes challenged me in more constructive ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I went deeper into quantitative finance and research, I began internalizing a more systematic,
          probabilistic way of thinking — optimizing for expected value rather than certainty.
          That framework has quietly reshaped how I approach decisions far beyond markets or math.
        </p>

        <p>
          In African American Studies, I was struck by how differently people could write about the same ideas.
          Navigating subjectivity — especially when there isn’t a single correct answer —
          forced me to engage with perspectives outside my usual way of thinking.
        </p>

        <h2>Responsibility at scale</h2>

        <p>
          Outside the classroom, the quarter was defined by responsibility.
          Alongside my role at KCC Capital Partners, I served on the executive board of De Anza Phi Beta Lambda,
          worked with TEDx De Anza, helped grow Polaris Research Group, and contributed to De Anza Hacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Phi Beta Lambda demanded the most. We ran a full recruiting cycle,
          took 60 members to San Diego for FBLA States, hosted our own Innovation Summit,
          and balanced consulting projects at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
          During midterms, everything converged — work deadlines, Polaris recruiting,
          and exams. I didn’t find a clever workaround.
          I just powered through and became more intentional about where my effort actually mattered.
        </p>

        <h2>Tradeoffs and clarity</h2>

        <p>
          This quarter clarified my direction. Another finance role, strong performance in math,
          and an invitation to the SIG Virtual Discovery Program reinforced that I’m moving in the right direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tradeoff was sleep. Most nights ended after 1 a.m.
          I also stopped actively initiating hangouts and learned to say no more often.
          Opportunities would come — I didn’t need to chase all of them.
        </p>

        <h2>Wins, misses, and honesty</h2>

        <p>
          Hosting the De Anza Innovation Summit, organizing TEDx De Anza’s CC to Success panel,
          running DA Hacks 4.0, and leading FBLA States showed me something important:
          I can manage large teams and execute under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, this quarter surfaced a pattern I can’t ignore.
          I overcommit and sometimes sacrifice my own well-being.
          That’s something I need to change.
        </p>

        <h2>Looking ahead</h2>

        <p>
          Next quarter, I’m narrowing my focus. I’m not adding anything new.
          With a lighter academic load, I want to reclaim time for myself —
          sleeping properly, working out, and building habits that are sustainable.
        </p>

          You don’t need to say yes to everything. Put yourself first and build something you can sustain.
